/*
    Payload telemetry documents have the SHA256 of the sentence string as their ID.
    This helps avoid the race condition of two people submitting the same string at
    the same time - CouchDB's optimistic concurrency model will block two people
    from creating a document with the same ID, so one will succeed and the other
    backs off, loads the new document and just appends a receiver.
