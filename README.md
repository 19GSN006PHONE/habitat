## Next Generation High Altitude Balloon Tracking System

habitat is a web application for tracking the flight path of high altitude
balloons, relying on a network of users with radios sending in received
telemetry strings which are parsed into position information and displayed
on maps.

Written by various UKHAS members, see AUTHORS
